title: "The Io Programming Language"
---

Welcome to this comprehensive guide to the Io programming language—a journey into prototype-based programming that will challenge and expand your understanding of object-oriented design.

## Why Io?

In a world dominated by class-based languages, Io offers a refreshingly different perspective. Everything is an object. Everything is a message. And everything can be changed at runtime.

## What You'll Learn

Through detailed comparisons with JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and Java, you'll discover:

- How prototype-based inheritance creates more flexible designs
- Why message passing is more powerful than method calls
- How to think in objects without classes
- The elegance of homoiconic languages

## Start Your Journey

Begin with the [Preface](/docs/) to understand Io's philosophy, or jump directly to [Getting Started](/docs/part-1-foundations/02-getting-started/) to write your first Io program.

*"Io's purpose is to refocus attention on expressiveness by exploring higher level dynamic programming features with greater levels of runtime flexibility."*
