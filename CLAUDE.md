# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.


## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive book about the Io Programming Language, written in Markdown format with one file per chapter. The book targets experienced programmers and provides in-depth comparisons with mainstream languages like JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and Java.

## Repository Structure

- **Root directory**: Contains 19 Markdown files (chapters 00-18) that make up the book
- **examples/**: Runnable Io code examples organized by chapter
  - Each chapter subdirectory contains `.io` files demonstrating concepts from that chapter
  - Examples can be run with: `io examples/chapter-XX/filename.io`

## Commands

### Running Io Code Examples
```bash
# Run any example file
io examples/chapter-02/hello.io

# Run Io REPL for interactive exploration
io
```

### Working with the Book Content
The book is written entirely in Markdown. Each chapter is a standalone `.md` file numbered sequentially (00-preface.md through 18-conclusion.md).

## Code Architecture

This is a documentation/book project, not a software application. The structure is:

1. **Book Content**: Individual Markdown files for each chapter containing:
   - Conceptual explanations
   - Code examples (inline in Markdown)
   - Comparisons to Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and Java
   - Exercises and "Try This" sections

2. **Example Code**: Standalone `.io` files in the `examples/` directory that readers can run to follow along with the book

## Key Considerations

- When editing chapters, maintain consistency in:
  - Code example formatting (use ```io code blocks)
  - Comparison style with other languages
  - Progressive building of concepts from earlier chapters
  
- When creating new Io examples:
  - Place them in the appropriate `examples/chapter-XX/` directory
  - Ensure they are self-contained and runnable
  - Include comments explaining key concepts

- The book emphasizes prototype-based programming concepts and frequently contrasts Io with class-based languages to help readers understand the paradigm shift

## Language Context

Io is:
- A prototype-based object-oriented language (like JavaScript's prototype system)
- Dynamically typed
- Homoiconic (code is data)
- Message-passing based
- Uses differential inheritance through cloning

Common Io patterns seen in examples:
- Everything is an object receiving messages
- Methods are defined as slots: `Object methodName := method(...)`
- Cloning for inheritance: `Child := Parent clone`
- Blocks for closures: `block(x, x * 2)`
=======
## Repository Purpose

This is a comprehensive book about the Io programming language, written entirely in Markdown. The book targets experienced programmers as a second or third language resource, focusing on prototype-based object-oriented programming concepts with comparisons to mainstream languages (JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java).

## Content Structure

The repository contains 19 numbered chapter files (00-preface.md through 18-conclusion.md) that form a complete technical book. Each chapter builds on previous concepts while maintaining standalone value. The `examples/` directory contains runnable Io code organized by chapter.

## Working with Content

### Running Examples
```bash
io examples/chapter-02/hello.io
```
Note: The Io interpreter may not be installed on all systems. Installation:
- macOS: `brew install io`
- Linux: Build from source at https://github.com/IoLanguage/io
- Windows: Use WSL or Docker

### Key Content Characteristics

1. **Technical Comparisons**: Examples frequently compare Io concepts to JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and Java equivalents
2. **Code Examples**: All code blocks are meant to be runnable in the Io REPL
3. **Benchmark Outputs**: Performance comparisons include representative timing outputs (e.g., Chapter 5 benchmarks)
4. **Progressive Complexity**: Early chapters introduce fundamentals, later chapters cover advanced topics like metaprogramming and concurrency

## Maintenance Guidelines

### When Adding Content
- Maintain consistent comparison style with other languages
- Include runnable code examples with expected outputs
- Place example files in appropriate `examples/chapter-XX/` directories
- Follow the established chapter numbering scheme

### When Reviewing Feedback
- The book has been reviewed by Steve Dekorte (Io's creator) - his feedback focused on adding outputs for benchmarks and expanding explanations for operator messages and common patterns

### Version Control
- The repository uses semantic versioning with tags (current: v1.1.0)
- Major content improvements warrant version bumps
- Include acknowledgments for technical reviewers in README.md

## Important Context

This book was generated by Claude (Opus 4.1) in collaboration with a human developer. The entire 400+ page book was created in a single conversation session, demonstrating AI-assisted technical writing capabilities. The content is released under CC0 1.0 Universal license, encouraging community contributions and corrections.
