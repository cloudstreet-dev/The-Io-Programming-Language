# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a comprehensive book about the Io programming language, written entirely in Markdown. The book targets experienced programmers as a second or third language resource, focusing on prototype-based object-oriented programming concepts with comparisons to mainstream languages (JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java).

## Content Structure

The repository contains 19 numbered chapter files (00-preface.md through 18-conclusion.md) that form a complete technical book. Each chapter builds on previous concepts while maintaining standalone value. The `examples/` directory contains runnable Io code organized by chapter.

## Working with Content

### Running Examples
```bash
io examples/chapter-02/hello.io
```
Note: The Io interpreter may not be installed on all systems. Installation:
- macOS: `brew install io`
- Linux: Build from source at https://github.com/IoLanguage/io
- Windows: Use WSL or Docker

### Key Content Characteristics

1. **Technical Comparisons**: Examples frequently compare Io concepts to JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and Java equivalents
2. **Code Examples**: All code blocks are meant to be runnable in the Io REPL
3. **Benchmark Outputs**: Performance comparisons include representative timing outputs (e.g., Chapter 5 benchmarks)
4. **Progressive Complexity**: Early chapters introduce fundamentals, later chapters cover advanced topics like metaprogramming and concurrency

## Maintenance Guidelines

### When Adding Content
- Maintain consistent comparison style with other languages
- Include runnable code examples with expected outputs
- Place example files in appropriate `examples/chapter-XX/` directories
- Follow the established chapter numbering scheme

### When Reviewing Feedback
- The book has been reviewed by Steve Dekorte (Io's creator) - his feedback focused on adding outputs for benchmarks and expanding explanations for operator messages and common patterns

### Version Control
- The repository uses semantic versioning with tags (current: v1.1.0)
- Major content improvements warrant version bumps
- Include acknowledgments for technical reviewers in README.md
